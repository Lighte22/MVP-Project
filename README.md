Technologies
This project was done with CANVA. CANVA is a graphic design tool used in creating professional designs for social media contents, presentations, videos, images and lots more. Images for the complete design of the web page were extracted from a few websites.

				About This Project
This project is intended for good use to those Who would want to refer people to their online store to see what they have to offer and what services they can render to people. This project generates a link to this web page just like the normal websites does which can be shared to friends and in the social media platforms.
One of the limitations of this web page project is that you may not be able to purchase items directly on this webpage. 
Those who are just starting their business or firms and who cannot afford the money to create a standard website can benefit from this project.
This project can be utilized in every location around the world.
There is practically no risk in this project except for the fact that failure to position your designs can lead to a disorganized web page. Therefore a lot of work needs to be put in place to make a good and appealing webpage that will serve the intended need.

			Progress


The above image vividly shows that there has been tremendous changes in the project so far.
The homepage, About us page and all the backgrounds are all fixed. The corresponding images have been fixed too.
The pending areas yet to be completed is the contact us section which is still underway.

			Challenges.
This web page has provision for redirection to other sites, so it was not an easy task making this possible. For a start, The sites that were supposed to be directed to were collected together and their links were sourced.
 Getting these were not as easy as we thought, linking these sites so that one can be directed to them via the web page.
As we got the links to these websites, another issue was on how to fix them in a way that will be easy to access. Getting the right buttons to place the links and position them was not as easy as it thought. Much work was put in place to achieve that.
Beautifying the colors, backgrounds and the needed pictures took a considerable amount of time too.
